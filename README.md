# [Dashboard](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/пумб-online/id1373626840) 

During my student days, I actively participated in scientific conferences at the university. For the scientific work "VISUALIZATION AS AN EFFECTIVE DATA ANALYTICS TOOL", I developed a dashboard that clearly demonstrates the importance of visualizing data, which improves perception.

Visual information is more engaging and easier to digest. With the help of visual charts and dashboards, even complex data sets can be made understandable.

The project I did when I took the Front End course. It helped me to better understand the HTML and to be able to make small websites on my own.

A simple game “Snake” is programmed in Python. 
It moves, catches “food” within a certain board and grows at the same time.

The game ‘Minesweeper’ is programmed in Java in ‘Processing’.

At the beginning of the game, a playing field with closed squares is displayed. The scoreboard shows the total number of unmarked mines and the game time. When the player makes the first click on one of the squares, several empty squares and squares with numbers open. The number on a square indicates the number of mines around it, i.e. in a 3×3 area centred on that square. Using hints, the player determines the exact location of the mines by marking them with a flag and opening cells without mines. Having flagged all the mines around a number square, the player can open all the remaining squares around it by clicking on that number. All cells without mines must be opened to win. If a player opens a cell with a mine, the game ends in defeat.
